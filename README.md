# Boid Simulation

This repository contains a Python implementation of a boid simulation using Pygame.

## Introduction

Boids are a type of artificial life program, simulating the flocking behavior of birds. This project demonstrates the principles of separation, alignment, and cohesion to simulate this behavior.

## Installation

To run this simulation, you need to have Python and Pygame installed. Follow the instructions below to set up your environment.

### Install Python

Download and install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Install Pygame

Use pip to install Pygame:

```sh
pip install pygame
